I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at Tel Aviv University's School of Political Science, Government, and International Affairs. I received my PhD from the University of Maryland. My main areas of interest revolve around rebel governance and the delivery of aid in violent contexts, but my work extends to other topics that span the causes and consequences of political violence.
